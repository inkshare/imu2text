# IMU Character Recognition with CNN + GNN

This project implements a handwriting character recognition pipeline using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Graph Neural Networks (GNN). The model achieves a classification accuracy of **99.74%** on the OnHW dataset.

## **Features**

- Combined CNN-GNN architecture for spatial and temporal feature extraction.
- Multi-Task Learning (MTL) to simultaneously classify characters and predict trajectories.
- Comprehensive data preprocessing pipeline for IMU sensor data.

## **Dataset**

We use the [OnHW Dataset](https://www.iis.fraunhofer.de/de/ff/lv/dataanalytics/anwproj/schreibtrainer/onhw-dataset.html), collected from IMU-enhanced pens, for training and evaluation. The dataset provides accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer readings along with ground truth labels.
